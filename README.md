# Overview
The starting point for explaining the Ackermann steering geometry is obvious: while on a bend, the outer front wheel traces a wider curve than the inner wheel (which has a narrower curve). A turning kart must have a rotation centre around which to do so, and around which the front wheels can rotate.
If the front wheels are perfectly parallel during the bend, no rotation centre would be created and the front wheels would slide, generating friction between tread and asphalt, tyre wear and loss of performance.

Ackermann’s steering geometry serves to offset the different direction covered by the front wheels along the curved trajectory to avoid this happening.
How? By causing the front wheels to rotate in a non-linear direction when turning the steering wheel. In doing so, a theoretical point is created (“theoretical” because, with the slipping of a 4-wheeled kart, the point actually varies) in which the 2 axes of the front wheels and the axis of the rear axle intersect.

Among other things, the bend geometry of a kart’s steering will lower the inner front wheel and lift the outer front wheel, with the transfer of much of the load to the front. The grip on the front is accentuated and the wheel travel direction is even more decisive.

In this project, we implement an Ackerman Steering controller for a robot. We assume that it is four-wheeled and rear drive robot. The task is to make the robot attain the desired heading and speed in a fixed World Frame. 

System Input: goal heading(degree, world frame), goal speed(degree, world frame)
System Output: inner wheel linear speed(m/s), outer wheel linear speed(m/s), inner wheel angle(degree, robot frame), outer wheel angle(degree, robot frame)

               
(For inner wheel angle and outer wheel angle, by robot frame, we mean that they are measured with respect to the robot's longitudinal axis)

# Assumptions
1. Four wheeled robot with rear wheel drive and front wheel steering
2. left turn is +ve rotation and right turn is -ve rotation
3. The initial heading and speed for the robot is zero
4. Friction is assumed to be minimum
5. robot can only steer 15 degrees in 1 second
6. Maximum linear speed of the robot is 16.667 m/s
7. Maximum acceleration possible is 1 m/s^2
8. Robot cannot go in reverse

# Results

# Known issues
1. Does not work well for right turns
2. works only when the robot is facing has zero speed and heading

Enter the target heading in degrees. To turn left enter +ve rotation in degrees and for right turn enter -ve rotation in degrees
Enter the target speed in m/s

# Building for code coverage 
```
sudo apt-get install lcov
cmake -D COVERAGE=ON -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../
make
make code_coverage
```
This generates a index.html page in the build/coverage sub-directory that can be viewed locally in a web browser.

# Doxygen

Doxygen is a tool used for generating software reference documentation.

To install it use 
```
sudo apt install doxygen
```
To generate doxygen documentation after installation use 
```
doxygen -g <config-file>
```
where ```<config-file>``` is the name of the configuration file that you want to create. 
In this file edit the input and output directories, and the files that have to be included or excluded while generating the Doxygen comments.
Finally, to run the Doxygen configuration file, use the following command
 ```
doxygen <config-file>
 ```
This will generate a HTML and LATEX output of the Doxygen comments inside the output directory specified in the configuration file.
